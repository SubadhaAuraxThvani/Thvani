                At Thvani, we prioritize your satisfaction and ensure the best quality in every product. However, due to the delicate handcrafted and organic nature of our creations, we accept exchanges only for unused, unwashed, and undamaged items with all original tags intact, provided a request is made within 7 days of delivery. Exchanges are subject to availability, and we do not entertain refunds. Custom-made orders are non-exchangeable. Please reach out to us for further assistance, and weâ€™ll be happy to help.

                    Thvani embraces the beauty of nature in its purest form. Our fabrics are botanically dyed using natural ingredients like onion peels, used rose petals from temples, and kitchen waste, ensuring zero chemical impact. Each piece is uniquely printed by bundling natural leaves and flowers onto the fabric, creating authentic impressions that make every garment truly one of a kind. This eco-friendly process ensures that every Thvani product is sustainable and carries its own distinct beauty, no two pieces being exactly alike.
